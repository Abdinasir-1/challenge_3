##What was the Challenge?
#The challenge was to create a Jenkins pipeline job that can build an image,test it and push the images to a nexus repository.

##How I expected the Challenge to go
#I expected the challenge to be straight forward however there were a few little complication that later popped up but 90% of it was as expected

##What went well?
#The installation of the nexus repository went well. I understood how to delete ports and replace them. I understood the process of the Jenkins pipeline especially how I created mine to build and run the container. The tutorials came in handy when addressing these scenarios.

##What didn't go as planned?
#There was an error on the build command which the I managed to find a solution for however Testing the app didn't go as planned. I faced a few errors

##Possible improvements for future challenges
To use more resources once conflicted with errors on the app and reduce syntax errors in the command-line which these are all working progress as the development continues.
